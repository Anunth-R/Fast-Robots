# Welcome to Fast MAE5190 Fast Robots

![Profile Picture](assets/images/profile.jpg)

Hello! I'm [Your Name], and this is my project for the MAE5190 Fast Robots course. In this project, we explore the world of high-speed robotics and autonomous systems. Below, you can find more about the course and the robots we'll be working with.

## About Me

I am a robotics enthusiast with a passion for designing fast, efficient systems. In this course, I am learning how to apply principles of control systems, robotics algorithms, and high-speed dynamics to build robots capable of moving at impressive speeds. I aim to push the boundaries of speed, precision, and control in autonomous systems.
