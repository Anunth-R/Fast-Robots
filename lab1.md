## Prelab
During the prelab, I setup my Arduino IDE and installed the nessesary libraries.
## Task 1: Blink
To test basic functionality of the board, I ran the Blink.io file.
## Task 2: Serial
After that, I tested my ability to send and recieve data over serial communication. This will be useful in the future when debugging my code. The messages were sent with a baud rate of 11520. 
## Task 3: Analog Read/Temperature Sensing

## Task 4: Microphone
