To begin, I planned out my motor control circuit. From the previous lab, I had already used A2 to control the XSHUT pin on one of my TOF sensors. Therefore, I decided to use pins A0, A1 to control one motor driver and pins A4,A5 to control the other motor driver. The car's motor control circuit wiring diagram is depicted below.

When building my circuit, I decided to try and make my wires as short as possible. I also tried to use stranded wire whenever I could to minmize the chance of a wire breaking. The car's mot
