# Prelab
In prior labs, my batteries had been placed in the battery compartment of the car without anything securing them other than the wires that connected them. However, in this lab, the car will be preforming high speed stunts which means that every component must be properly sucured. Therefore, I added an extra rubber band to ensure that the batteries would not fall out of the car incase it crashed into a wall or flipped over.

The car is now ready to preform stunts!

# Drifting
The drift stunt consists of three different steps.

* Approach: The car must quickly approach to 3ft from the wall.
* Drift: A quick 180 degree turn to orient the car towards its start direction.
* Return: The car returns as quickly as possible to the start line.
