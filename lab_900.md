# Results

Below are the results from localizing at each grid point. The green point corresponds to the ground truth while the blue point corresponds to the robot's belief. I uploaded two distinct plots when the dots were too close together.

## (5,-3)

As shown from the plots above, the belief is perfectly accurate compared to the ground truth. However, it is important to note that the localization uses grid cells so there is still some rounding going on. Nevertheless, the localization worked really well here.
