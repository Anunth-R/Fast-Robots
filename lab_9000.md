# Introduction

Instead of going the traditional route of doing localization, I was inspired by Stephen Wagner's final project of balancing the car as an inverted pendulum. However, he was able to only get the car to balance when it started near a vertical position. In his final thoughts, he stated that it would be cool if a future reader was able to get the car to flip up on its own and balance itself. Therefore, I decided to form a group with Aravind Ramaswami and Nita Kattimani to tackle this challenge.

# Approach

We broke making a robot flip up on its own and balance itself, we first modeled the robot as a non-linear dynamic model and linearized it about its its vertical equilibrium point. Using this model, we constructed a Kalman Filter observer to estimate the state of the robot. We also used pole placement to derive state space controller gains that stabalize the system. To actually get the car to flip upward, we created an open loop controller that causes the car to flip. Finally, we created a state machine which activates all of these pieces at the correct time to allow the car to successfully preform the maneuver. 

# System Modeling

We modeled our car balancing problem as a wheel with a stick attached to it. Therefore, we can describe our system using the following state vector consisting of the cart's x position, velocity, theta, and angular velocity.
